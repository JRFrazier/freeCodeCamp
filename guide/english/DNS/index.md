# DNS
**DNS stands for Domain Name System.**

The basic functionality of **DNS** is *associating a domain name with an IP address.* 

There are three different type cycles of DNS that the recursive name server goes through to get the IP address of the domain in the web browser. 

* Root domain is the highest hierarchical level of a site and is separated from the Top Level Domain (TLD) by a dot.
